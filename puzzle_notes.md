Very proud of finishing this one. The parsing took for ever but the real struggle came from part 2. My brain melted trying to come up with the recursive way of getting the sum. Exanding the "in" node was kind of easy but I am not sharp in recursion.

I was going to quite but was able to reduce the ranges and noticed that I needed to force not inclusive sets. 0-4001 then I just play with numbers until the test passed XD
