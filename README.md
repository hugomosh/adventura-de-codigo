# Adventura de codigo

Mi viaje por Advent of Code probando nuevos lenguajes y configurando para hacer de Aoc una experiencia de aprendizaje y diversi√≥n.

Expect mucho Spanglish.

## How to correr adventura

```
ruby main.rb
```

Crea los archivos del dia dado y va a vigilar cambios en el folder del input y del archivo.

## Todos

- [x] Download input file
- [x] Create class to solve puzzle of the day from a template
- [x] Autoload the created puzzle classed
- [x] Watch for changes in file.
  - [ ] Refactor
  - [ ] Also watch the given day.
- [ ] Wait for 9PM PT to auto download input.
- [ ] Open freshly created files in editor
- [ ] Add test cases

## My helper command

The idea would be to run AdventuraDeCodigo

And it will tell you.
We are in December! Trying to resolve the current day.

If not, please select one option.

1. Resolve a given day.
2. Wait for the freshedt day.
3. Continue solving

Would be nice to have a config file per day so I can add tests and the final solutions.

It should also be able to update the answer, eventually.
